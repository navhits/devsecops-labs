# DevSecOps Labs

A very basic DevSecOps lab with samples and steps to use some tools to improve code quality. Just using these examples, won't get you anywhere :D Obviously as an AppSec Engineer, you need to know a lot more than just using tools. Like basic data manipulation tools in linux, bash scripts and more. As a DevSecOps Engineer, you will need a lot more than technical skills to get you a long way.

I'll do my best to add more exercises. Hoping to improve the labs over time...

## Available labs

1. [Basic code scanning](lab1/)
2. [Code scanning in CI/CD](lab2/)
