## Why??????

DockerHub imposed rate limits for non-authenticated pulls. So the images are built and kept here. You are free to pull these images from here. Not that GHCR does not have rate limits. But at this point only the consumers of this repo is expected to use these images.

They are the exact same official images of the various tools, unless its specified that its a custom docker image.
